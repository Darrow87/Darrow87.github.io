   Hi guys, hope everyone has been doing well. Today I'll be writing a post on arrays and hashes
    </p>

    <p>
So basically, an arrays and hashes are both ways of storing data so you can access them. You would create an array so that you can easily iterate over it. You can so many things to an array like sort it, and an array can be composed of an integer or a string. However, you access an array by it's index number, and figuring this out can be tricky, and adding an item and remembering what it's index number is later can also be tricky.
    </p>
    <p>
 So, if you want to store a lot of data that is easier to access you can use a hash. A hash, instead of essentially being a list of information, is a list of information that has two components, a key and a value. For example, an array would just be ["Seven","A Beautiful Mind", "Wedding Crashers"] But a hast would be [Horror:"Seven", Drama: "A Beautiful Mind", Comedy "Wedding Crashers"]
    </p>
    <p>
So as you can see the item is organized in a more specific in a hash. You can access a hash value through its key, for example hash[comedy] returns "Wedding Crashers." This allows you to label your information for later use. If wedding crashers were in an array you would need to figure out which index it was in to access it, but with a hash you can rememeber it is a comedy and access it that way.
