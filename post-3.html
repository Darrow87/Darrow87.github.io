   Hi guys, hope everyone has been doing well. Today I'll be writing a post on arrays and hashes
    </p>

    <p>
Okay, so basically, arrays and hashes are both ways of storing data so you can access them. You would create an array so that you can easily iterate over it. You can do many things to an array like sort it, and an array can be composed of an integer or a string. However, you access an array by its index number, and figuring this out can be tricky if you have a lot of information to go through. Adding an item and remembering what its index number is later can also be tricky.
    </p>
    <p>
 So, if you want to store a lot of data that is easier to access you can use a hash. A hash, instead of being just a list of information, is a list of information that has two components, a key and a value. For example, an array would just be Array = ["Seven","A Beautiful Mind", "Wedding Crashers"] But a hash would be Hash = [Horror:"Seven", Drama: "A Beautiful Mind", Comedy "Wedding Crashers"]
    </p>
    <p>
As you can see the items are organized more specifically in a hash. You can access a hash value through its key, for example hash[comedy] returns "Wedding Crashers." This allows you to label your information for later use. If wedding crashers were in an array you would need to figure out which index it was in to access it, but with a hash you can rememeber it is a comedy and access it that way.
