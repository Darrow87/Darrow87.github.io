 Hey there, this post will be comparing an aspect of Ruby to an aspect of Javascript.
    </p>

    <p>
One big difference between Ruby and Javascript (JS) that I've noticed is the way you loop. In Ruby, you do not really need to use for loops, but it JS that is the most important way to loop.
    </p>
    <p>
Ruby has built in interators such as .each that will automatically iterate over an array. This is extremely convenient. However, in JS you need to create a for loop with a counter that will count the number of items in the array. This is sort of annoying at first, but from what I understand it is very prevelant in other languages as well so I better get used to it!
