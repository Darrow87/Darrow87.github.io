 Hey there, this post will be me doing some research on recursion and attempting to explain it.
    </p>

    <p>
So I haven't really worked with recursion yet, so what I'm about to write is just based on some prelimiary research I've done.
    </p>
    <p>
Recursion is the idea that a solution to a problem depends on solution to smaller instances of the same problem. It is executed by having a function call itself. Recrusion is an alternative to interation.
    </p>

    <p>
Recursion is the combination of base cases and recursive cases. A recursive case is a case where the function is required to call itself to progress, whereas a base case is when the problem has been reduced enough for the function to solve it without calling itself again. A base case must be tested and must existed or else an infinite loop is triggered.
