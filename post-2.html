      What up, post 2?! Ha, writing this in my html I keep forgetting that this will actually be available for people to read. I better call my grandma and ask her how to write a blog post. Wait, ...what? Ok anyways I'm going to be writing about the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning!!!! Yay!!!!!!!
    </p>

    <p>
      What are the differences between relative, absolute, fixed, and static positioning?

      That's a great question. I'm going to go research that right now actually by copying that exact sentence into google, one sec.

      Alright I'm back with an answer. So here's the deal. <strong>Static positioning </strong>is where an object would fall on your page if you did not apply any positioning to it at all. You can think of it as the default positioning of an object on your website.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Relative positioning </strong>is when you plan to move an object <em> in relation to </em> it's static position. So when using relative positioning you first ask, "where would this object be if it's position were static?" Then whatever positioning you apply to it will move it starting from that spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Absolute positioning</strong> is when you say, I want this object in this exact location and I don't give a shit what else is going on! Meaning, it might overlap or underlap something and it will stay there when you scroll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, <strong>fixed positioning</strong> is when you want an object to say at a certain place on the page regardless of scrolling. For example, you put a bar at the top of a page and you want it to remain there even when you scroll down!
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have questions then you should probably just start to cry. Just kidding, ask me. Wait you can't because you don't have my contact info. Go look it up!!! :P
