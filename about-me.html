    <h2> Bio </h2>
    <p> Hey guys, my name is Alex! I'm an aspiring developer based in NYC. I enjoy playing chess and playing guitar, singing, and writing songs!</p>

    <p> For undergrad I went to Michigan State University and played on the varsity tennis team for 4 years. Next, I went to law school at Tulane University, all the way down in New Orleans! After that I moved to New York and started working at JPMorgan Chase managing credit risk for interest rate swaps. However, I moved into the legal and compliance department, where I tried my hand and automating some processes through VBA, and thus my interest in programming was born!</p>

     <p> I'm thrilled to be starting at Devbootcamp on February 8th, where I'll be learning web development with the Ruby on Rails framework. </p>
