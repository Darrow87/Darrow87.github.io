What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

That if you play around with it long enough without really knowing what it does you can still get it right. Also that you can easily look up the syntax you need online.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I basically just learned the syntax for it. I haven't really used any of the more advanced relational commands, so I think I need to go back and review them.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I had a table on my main page where I just needed borders for columns which is not an explicit command so I needed to tinker with that for a minute to figure it out.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I learned that one missing bracket messes everything up. I struggled for about an hour having no idea why it wasn't working then I realized that one of my brackets was missing. Argh.
